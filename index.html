                <p>Students at UofSC have been struggling to attend online classes, as meeting times are not as
                    straightforward as a physical schedule would be. For example, Zoom does not include any
                    notification system to remind students when meetings will begin, as students are forced to
                    memorize codes and passwords each session, rather than entering them once and being able
                    to press a button to instantly join a Zoom meeting again, making a schedule impossible.
                    Meetings are also spread out over a multitude of different programs including Blackboard,
                    Zoom, and even Discord. Our solution should keep everyone on track for classes by providing
                    notifications for when and where your class will be.
